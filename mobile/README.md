# Setup
Use a [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to setup all necessary dependencies. No matter operational system and the compilation target (iOS / android) you'll always need to have `node` and `yarn` (`npm install yarn -g`) installed.

Upon the code checkout, run `yarn` to build an application.
Run `yarn watch` command to monitor code changes.

For a better user experience, install
1. VS Code
2. React Native Tools extension for VS Code (use it to run the app on simulator)
