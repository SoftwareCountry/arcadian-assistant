# Setup
Use a [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to setup all necessary dependencies. No matter operational system and the compilation target (iOS / android) you'll always need to have `node` and `yarn` (`npm install yarn -g`) installed.

Upon the code checkout, run `yarn` to build an application. `yarn watch` command monitors code changes.
